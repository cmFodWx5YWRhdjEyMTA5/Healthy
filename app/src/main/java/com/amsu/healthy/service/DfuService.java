       *
       * when user press it. Using NotificationActivity we can check whether the new activity is a root activity (that means no other activity was open before)
       * or that there is other activity already open. In the later case the notificationActivity will just be closed. System will restore the previous activity.
       * However if the application has been closed during upload and user click the notification a NotificationActivity will be launched as a root activity.
       * It will create and start the main activity and terminate itself.
       *
       * This method may be used to restore the target activity in case the application was closed or is open. It may also be used to recreate an activity
       * history (see NotificationActivity).
