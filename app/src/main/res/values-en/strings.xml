    <string name="heart_rate_reserve_decrible">Heart rate reserve is the difference of maximum heart rate and resting heart rate, and it is closely related to the resistance during exercise. The higher the heart rate reserve, the better the resistance. </string>
    <string name="heart_rate_recovery_decrible">heart rate recovery: after intense exercise, the decrease of heart rate in the next 3 minutes. In general, the healthier the individual, the larger the heart rate drop; the faster the heart rate drop, the better recovery of the individual for another intense training. Therefore, it is useful for assessing health. </string>
    <string name="heart_rate_variability_decrible">heart rate variability can derive a lot of health indicators, one of the most used ones is physical fatigue index (SDNN) and mood and mental index (LF/HF). </string>
    <string name="heart_rate_slow_fast_decrible">normal individual heart rate is 45–105 beat/min, heart rate too slow is less than 45; heart rate too fast is greater than 105 beat/min. </string>
    <string name="premature_beat_missed_beat_decrible">Premature heartbeat is the most frequent arrhythmia, which is caused by an ectopic pacemaker. If there is a short shot, it is a leak, which is usually a combination of premature beat. Frequent premature beat will damage the function of the myocardium, induce myocardial ischemia, some premature beat can also induce ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation</string>
    <string name="health_reserve_decrible">We use the time of exercise each week to assess your health reserve, and help you customizean exercise plan. We recommend 30 mins of cardio each day, 60 mins the best, and accumulatively 420 mins per week, but not exceeding 90 minutes per ay.</string>
    <string name="health_BMI_decrible">(body mass index, referred to as BMI), is obtained by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared figure, is a commonly used measure body fat levels and whether the international health is one of the important standards.
