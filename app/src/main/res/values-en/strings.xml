In general, the healthier the individual, the larger the heart rate drop; the faster the heart rate drop, the better recovery of the individual for another intense training. Therefore, it is useful for assessing health. </string>

    <string name="health_reserve_decrible">We use the time of exercise each week to assess your health reserve, and help you customizean exercise plan. We recommend 30 mins of cardio each day, 60 mins the best, and accumulatively 420 mins per week, but not exceeding 90 minutes per ay.</string>
